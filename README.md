## Pimp My Ride

A concept website of a car customizing company, inspired by the old mtv show Pimp My Ride.

### Motivation

I wanted to gain further experience building a static website with vanilla js. The goal is to create a seo friendly, responsive, and accessible website with a clean design. The website should also have great performance.
